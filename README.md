## 🧠 Objective

This repository is part of a study task under Feynn Labs, focused on applying market segmentation techniques using a case study of McDonald’s. The goal is to replicate part of the segmentation process through a simple KMeans clustering model based on consumer brand perceptions.

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Dataset Creation**  
   A mock dataset was created using binary responses (YES/NO → 1/0) for the following attributes:  
   - YUMMY  
   - GREASY  
   - CHEAP  
   - HEALTHY  
   - DISGUSTING  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Converted YES/NO responses to numerical format  
   - Normalized input data for clustering

3. **Clustering Technique Used**  
   - `KMeans` from `scikit-learn`  
   - Tried different cluster sizes and visualized results using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

4. **Interpretation**  
   - Identified clusters representing positive and negative perceptions of McDonald’s  
   - Analyzed how brand image varies among customer segments
